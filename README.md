# GeoQB

_The GeoQB project makes multi-layer graph management as easy as making a cake._

What [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is for managing cloud applications, GeoQB is for multi-facet graph data management.

## How Terraform inspires the work on GeoQB?
_Write, Plan, Apply_ <--- from Terraform website

GeoQB is an open-source 'data asset as code' software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage a variety of cloud data services. GeoQB codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files. this way it allows you to manage the state of large scale graph applications on TigerGraph.
Our goal is supporting the data community to use the FAIR data principles.
